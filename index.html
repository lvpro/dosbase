<h2>What Is DOSBase?</h2>

<p>If you are serious about MP3 collecting you <I>need</I> this tool! DOSBase is a
multifunctional list creation utility for mp3 collectors. It is a win32
console application with an easy to use interactive interface. It is intended to be used by
collectors who name their mp3 files with a particular naming convention (such as title -
artist.mp3 or (title)_artist.mp3. DOSBase intelligently extracts all information 
(titles and artists) and creates nice looking TXT files or HTML documents you can use
to trade with or keep inventory (<a href="list.html">example html output<a/> , 
<a href="list.txt">example ASCII text output</a>).
If you don't feel comfortable with it, keep using it!
Chances are the features you are looking for are in this utility. This utility is
<I>definitely</I> worth taking the time to learn!!</p>

<h2>Freeware</h2>

<p>DOSBase is freeware and may be used and distributed as much as you so desire.
&nbsp; However, no cost may be placed on DOSBase including any usage of it.&nbsp; 
I'm considering taking the existing code and putting a windows interface on it.
Would anyone find this useful?  I know some of you enjoy the DOS type 
feel of the program.  Got new idears for a new project?&nbsp; E-mail me:&nbsp; DJSlakoR@hotmail.com</p>
